%description
Locket implements a lock that can be used by multiple processes provided they
use the same path.

Locks largely behave as (non-reentrant) Lock instances from the threading
module in the standard library. Specifically, their behaviour is:

 * Locks are uniquely identified by the file being locked, both in the same
   process and across different processes.
 * Locks are either in a locked or unlocked state.
 * When the lock is unlocked, calling acquire() returns immediately and
   changes the lock state to locked.
 * When the lock is locked, calling acquire() will block until the lock state
   changes to unlocked, or until the timeout expires.
 * If a process holds a lock, any thread in that process can call release()
   to change the state to unlocked.
 * Behaviour of locks after fork is undefined.
