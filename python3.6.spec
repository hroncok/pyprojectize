# ==================================
# Notes from bootstraping Python 3.6
# ==================================
#
# New Python major version (3.X) break ABI and bytecode compatibility,
# so all packages depending on it need to be rebuilt.
#
# Due to a dependency cycle between Python, gdb, rpm, pip, setuptools, wheel,
# and other packages, this isn't straightforward.
# Build in the following order:
#
# 1. At the same time:
#     - gdb without python support (add %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#       gdb's SPEC file)
#     - python-rpm-generators
#       (this can be done also during step 2., but should be done before 3.)
# 2. python3 without rewheel (use %%bcond_with rewheel instead of
#     %%bcond_without)
# 3. gdb with python support (remove %%global _without_python 1 on top of
#    gdb's SPEC file)
# 4. rpm
# 5. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 1
# 6. python-pip with build_wheel set to 0
# 7. python-wheel with %%bcond_without bootstrap
# 8. python-setuptools with bootstrap set to 0 and also with_check set to 0
# 9. python-pip with build_wheel set to 1
# 10. pyparsing
# 11. python3 with rewheel
#
# Then the most important packages have to be built, in dependency order.
# These were:
#   python-sphinx, pytest, python-requests, cloud-init, dnf, anaconda, abrt
#
# After these have been built, a targeted rebuild should be done for the rest.

# Original names for architectures with different names downstream
#
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Python_Upstream_Architecture_Names
#
# Pythons in RHEL/Fedora used different names for some architectures
# than upstream and other distros (for example ppc64 vs. powerpc64).
# This was patched in patch 274, now it is sedded if %%with legacy_archnames.
#
# That meant that an extension built with the default upstream settings
# (on other distro or as an manylinux wheel) could not been found by Python
# on RHEL/Fedora because it had a different suffix.
# This patch adds the legacy names to importlib so Python is able
# to import extensions with a legacy architecture name in its
# file name.
# It work both ways, so it support both %%with and %%without legacy_archnames.
#
# WARNING: This patch has no effect on Python built with bootstrap
# enabled because Python/importlib_external.h is not regenerated
# and therefore Python during bootstrap contains importlib from
# upstream without this feature. It's possible to include
# Python/importlib_external.h to this patch but it'd make rebasing
# a nightmare because it's basically a binary file.

# complexity. This is a mitigation for CVE-2020-10735
# (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10735).
#
# This new limit can be configured or disabled by environment variable, command

# Limitation` documentation.  The default limit is 4300

#
# Notes on the backport to Python 3.6:
#
# * Use "Python 3.6.15-13" version in the documentation, whereas this
#   version will never be released
# * Only add _Py_global_config_int_max_str_digits global variable:
#   Python 3.6 doesn't have PyConfig API (PEP 597) nor _PyRuntime.
# * sys.flags.int_max_str_digits cannot be -1 on Python 3.6: it is
#   set to the default limit. Adapt test_int_max_str_digits() for that.
# * Declare _PY_LONG_DEFAULT_MAX_STR_DIGITS and
#   _PY_LONG_MAX_STR_DIGITS_THRESHOLD macros in longobject.h but only
#   if the Py_BUILD_CORE macro is defined.
# * Declare _Py_global_config_int_max_str_digits in pydebug.h.

%description
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{name} package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{name}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{name}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{name}-tkinter and %{name}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{name}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{name}-" prefix.

%description debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between
this and the standard version of Python, but the debugging features mean that
C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version
separately.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag ("d") in the filename,
so extensions for both versions can co-exist in the same directory.
