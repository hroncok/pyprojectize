# Much of Unicorn follows from QEMU, which the Unicorn project forked in
# 2015. Since then, the Unicorn team has applied a number of bugfixes to
# the forked QEMU code along with the modifications necessary for Unicorn.
# QEMU 2.2.1 formed the basis of this work. The Unicorn project documents
# the relationship between Unicorn and QEMU at
# http://www.unicorn-engine.org/docs/beyond_qemu.html.
Provides: bundled(qemu) = 2.2.1
